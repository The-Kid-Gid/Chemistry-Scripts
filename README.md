# Chemistry-Scripts
I created this repository initially to house a simple Ideal Gas Law TI-BASIC script I made to make chemistry class a little easier. I look forward to adding more useful scripts and expanding this repository, so if anyone has any useful hacks feel free to create a pull request and share your stuff!
