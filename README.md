# Chemistry-Scripts

I created this repository initially to house a simple Ideal Gas Law TI-BASIC script I made to make chemistry class a little easier. I look forward to adding more useful scripts and expanding this repository, so if anyone has any useful stuff feel to contribute. Information on how to use the scripts found in this repository can be found in the Installation Instructions section of the wiki.
